1	Is GAGA associated with nucleosome-free regions (NFR)?	The GAGA factor is a protein known to be involved in the formation and/or maintenance of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin. The interactions of GAGA factor and heat shock factor with their binding sites in chromatin occurred in two modes.

In the presence of ATP both factors interacted also with nucleosomal binding sites, causing nucleosome rearrangements and a refinement of nucleosome positions. While chromatin remodeling upon transcription factor interaction has previously been interpreted to involve nucleosome disruption, the data suggest energy-dependent nucleosome sliding as main principle of chromatin reorganization.

CSB is the human TCR coupling factor and Mfd is the bacterial TCR coupling factor. However, unlike Mfd, CSB does not act as a helicase nor does it dissociate stalled RNA polymerase II, suggesting a coupling mechanism in humans different from that in prokaryotes. Moreover, Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage.

1	Is there a role for transcription factories in genome organization?	The mammalian nucleus is a highly complex structure that carries out a diverse range of functions such as DNA replication, cell division, RNA processing, and nuclear export/import. Many of these activities occur at discrete subcompartments that intersect with specific regions of the genome. Over the past few decades, evidence has accumulated to suggest that RNA transcription also occurs in specialized sites, called transcription factories, that may influence how the genome is organized. There may be certain efficiency benefits to cluster transcriptional activity in this way. However, the clustering of genes at transcription factories may have consequences for genome stability, and increase the susceptibility to recurrent chromosomal translocations that lead to cancer

1	Is there any software for automated analysis of immuno-histochemistry images?	In some studies of breast cancer, quantitation of immunohistochemically highlighted microvessel ‘hot spots’ has been shown to be a powerful prognostic tool. However, the antibody used, the number and size of the ‘hot spots’ assessed, and the stratification of patients into high and low vascular groups vary between studies. Furthermore, little is known about the relationship between microvessel density and other vascular parameters. These uncertainties and the laborious nature of the technique make it unsuitable for diagnostic practice. Both manual and computerized image analysis techniques were used in this study to examine the relationship between microvessel density and the vascular parameters in different sized microscopic fields in a pilot series of 30 invasive breast carcinomas. Automated pixel analysis of immunohistochemical staining, Chalkley point counting, and observer subjective vascular grading were also assessed as more rapid methods of measuring tumour vascularity

An excess of conserved predicted MARs is seen in intergenic regions preceding 5' ends of genes, suggesting that these MARs are primarily involved in transcriptional control.

1	Is Tuberous Sclerosis a genetic disease?	Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance, variable expressivity, and incomplete penetrance. Two thirds of TSC cases result from sporadic genetic mutations, not inheritance, but their offspring may inherit it from them. Current genetic tests have difficulty locating the mutation in approximately 20% of individuals diagnosed with the disease. So far it has been mapped to two genetic loci, TSC1 and TSC2. TSC1 encodes for the protein hamartin, is located on chromosome 9 q34 and was discovered in 1997. TSC2 encodes for the protein Tuberin, is located on chromosome 16 p13.3 and was discovered in 1993. TSC2 is contiguous with PKD1, the gene involved in one form of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Gross deletions affecting both genes may account for the 2% of individuals with TSC who also develop PKD in childhood. TSC2 has been associated with a more severe form of TSC. However, the difference is subtle and cannot be used to identify the mutation clinically. Estimates of the proportion of TSC caused by TSC2 range from 55% to 80-90%.

A rare variant of the TREM2 gene, which encodes the triggering receptor encoded in myeloid cells 2 (rs75932628-T) causing a R47H substitution has been associated with both early and late onset Alzheimer's disease in various populations.  Emerging evidence has demonstrated that TREM2 could suppress inflammatory response by repression of microglia-mediated cytokine production and secretion, which may prevent inflammation-induced bystander damage of neurons. Higher levels of TREM2 mRNA (p = 0.002) and protein (p < 0.001) were identified in AD patients which indicates that TREM2 might serve as a novel noninvasive biomarker for AD diagnosis. Based on the potential protective actions of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis, targeting TREM2 might provide new opportunities for AD treatment.

1	Is there a role for the cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD) in lung cancer?	To explore a correlation between CYLD expression and responsiveness to TRAIL in lung cancer cell lines, we established lung cancer cell lines that stably express CYLD. Our data provided the first evidence that increased expression of CYLD directly blocks TRAIL-induced NF - B activation, and consequently increases TRAIL-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. CYLD may act as a therapeutic target of lung cancer. Targeting CYLD, in combination with TRAIL, may be a new strategy to treat lung cancer with high NF - B activity. Cyld encodes a 956-amino acid deubiquitinating enzyme, which is a negative regulator of nuclear factor kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Mutations that truncate and inactivate the carboxyl-terminal deubiquitinating domain of CYLD underlie the development of skin appendage tumors in humans, whereas down-regulation of Cyld expression has been associated with the development of various types of human malignancies including lung cancer. To establish an animal model of human CYLD inactivation and characterize the biological role of CYLD in vivo, we generated mice carrying a homozygous deletion of Cyld exon 9 mice ) using a conditional approach. Our study identifies an important role of CYLD in lung maturation, which may underlie the development of many cases of lung cancer.
